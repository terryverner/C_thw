# Learn C the Hard Way
## by Zed Shaw

I will be completing the exercises from Zed's book. He says it best in the introduction to [Learn C the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/)...

## What You Will Learn
The purpose of this book is to get you strong enough in C that you'll be able to write your own software with it or modify someone else's C code. After this book, you should read The C Programming Language (Prentice Hall 1988) a book by the creators of the C language, also called K&R C. What I'll teach you is:  

- The basics of C syntax and idioms  
- Compilation, make files, linkers  
- Finding bugs and preventing them  
- Defensive coding practices  
- Breaking C code  
- Writing basic UNIX systems software  

By the final exercise, you will have more than enough ammunition to tackle basic systems software, libraries, and other smaller projects.
